# What is this?
LBI - stands for **Lua Bytecode Interperter**, a way of executing scripts into ROBLOX's engine. I developed this so people can understand how it works and use this as their first DLL source for starting roblox exploiting. When you execute the script, it sends it to ROBLOX or deserializer. It might not execute scripts that are rarely used.
